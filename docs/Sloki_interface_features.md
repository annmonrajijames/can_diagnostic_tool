# Sloki Interface Features

The `Sloki_interface` branch introduces several enhancements to the CAN diagnostic tool:

- Dedicated benchmarking tools for comparing PEAK and Sloki hardware performance.
- PySide6-based performance statistics GUI with embedded J2534 API support.
- CAN frame statistics utilities for both Sloki and PEAK interfaces, including interactive start options.
- Restart controls to reset message counts and cycle time in performance monitors.
- Corrected cycle time formatting via `Sloki_Settings_page.py` for accurate display in the live signal viewer.
